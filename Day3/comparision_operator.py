# 5 Comparison operators, also called relational operators, are
# used to compare two values
# 5 Comparison operators will always provide Boolean result that
# is True and False
# 5 comparison operators are as follow
# 5 == Equal t<
# 5 != Not Equal to3
# 5 > Greater than3
# 5 < Less than 3
# 5 >= Greater than or equal t<
# 5 <= Less than or equal t<
# 5 Comparison operators will work with numbers but you can
# use them with strings as well.3
# 5 Strings will be comparing the Ascii values of string.
a = 12 
b = 12 

print (a == b)
print (a != b)


# we can also use assignment operator in string 

print (ord("A"))
print (ord("B"))

print ("ABC" > "BAS")

# We can not compare string with integer
