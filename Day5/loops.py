# there is two loops in python for and while looop
# range function accept therr thing it except start , stop , steps  we use range function in for loops 

# a = range(1,21,1)

# for i in range(1,21,1):
#     print(i)

# range for the string 

# a = "Mohit"

# for i in  range(len(a)):
#     print(a[i]) 


# a = "Singh"

# for char in a:
#     print(char)

# for i in range(20,51):
#     print(i)
    
# for i in range(16,0,-1):
#     print(i)
    
# for i in range(-5,-16,-1):
#     print(i)


#break and continue statement 

# for i in  range(1, 21):
#     if i == 15+1:
#         break
#     else:
#         print(i)
